## 2012-07-12 "exmachina" configuration management layer

- this new code is very ugly and in the "just make it work" style
- add exmachina code and test code
- modify plinth.py to listen for shared secret on stdin at start
  (if appropriate flag is set) and try to connect to exmachina daemon
- use exmachina to read and set /etc/hostname as a demo
- update plinth init.d script to start exmachina and share keys
- update docs with new deps and run instructions

## 2012-02-27 new theme based upon bootstrap

Added Bootstrap code from Twitter's Bootstrap http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap
Additional images, css changes
Consolidated Bootstrap, Boilerplate, HTML5-Reset code
Edited text and forms for some modules (as a CMS, Plinth's fetching of text and forms from static files needs rethinking)
Changed menu javascript to work with Bootstrap styles

## 2012-02-24 template and theme changes

Added HTML5-Reset code http://html5reset.org
Removed robots.txt (we have "noindex,nofollow" in the template meta tags, do we need this?)
Added meta noindex,nofollow,noarchive tags for specific robots (googlebot etc.)
Removed extraneous meta tags useful only for indexing
Removed HTML5-Reset "_" directory.  Not sure why it's useful to add an ambiguous folder to the directory tree.
Made sure no Google-y code wasn't included (analytics, remote copy of JQuery, etc.)
Fixed symbolic link docs/style.css
New favicon and iOS "web clip" button
